  <h1>Melbourne to Sydney</h1>

  <p>
    The plan is to cycle from Melbourne to Sydney. The route is meant
    to be interesting, rather than direct or easy. Though the hope is
    that interesting keeps me off of main highways a bit as cars are
    depressing and who wants to be seen near one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The route in total is around 1250km, with 10 days of riding. I
    have aimed for around 130km a day and adjusted for good places to
    stop. The shortest day is about 90km, the longest is about 150km.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am writing all this down so I actually make a plan beyond start
    pedalling and don't stop. It also makes it easier to share with
    people. I aim to start with the route, but keep adding details as
    I get more organised.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will just be me, so I will be carrying everything on my bike.
    I will aim to be staying in towns at motels and very much enjoying
    a warm shower and bed at the end of each day. Though I will take a
    basic camping set-up if I get stuck or really want to stop
    somewhere.
  </p>

  <h2>Set-up</h2>

  <p>
    Will add more as I fine tune everything, but some details to
    get started.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going to be riding a gravel bike. There are a bunch of reasons I
    decided to do this over riding my road bike, but the main ones are
    a bit of flexibility on route - comfort difference on dirt/gravel
    is significant, and storage - just more mounts with the bike
    handling well when it is loaded up.

  <p>
    Bags and general storage are: On the bike, I have in-frame storage
    for tools and maybe some extra food as well as cargo cages on the
    front forks. Bags I am have a front-roll, half-frame bag, top-tube
    back, and a food/stuff bag for handlebars. I then also have a
    tailfin trunk bag for bulky things.
  </p>

  <h2>Route</h2>

  <p>
    This is all tentative, I have concentrated on getting the rough
    route and identifying the stops. The details, for example riding
    through Melbourne, need a bit of work. I am getting some feedback
    from people who know various parts of the ride better than me, but
    this gives a pretty good idea of where I am going.
